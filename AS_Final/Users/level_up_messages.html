<!-- LEVEL 6 -->
<p>Here are some new things you need to know:</p><p>Level 6 now includes 4 training days instead of 3. The new training day has a number of new movement patterns and exercises, including many that do not use an RPE value. For RFD Unloaded 1, RFD unloaded 2, RFD Loaded, and Medicine Ball, these are \'power\' exercises where the intent is to move quickly and explosively, as RFD stands for \'Rate of Force Development.\' It will be up to you to determine the right weight or medicine ball to use, as weight that is too heavy will be too difficult to move with the correct velocity. In general, you should be resting 2-4 minutes in between working sets for all power exercises. Be sure to watch the corresponding Level 6 videos to become familiar with the new exercise variations.</p>

<!-- LEVEL 11 -->
<p>Here are some new things you need to know:</p><p>There are now two training blocks per level instead of one. Block 1 is a Volume block, with higher repetitions per set and no power-related exercises. Rather than total body emphasis every day, training days are split between two lower body-dominant days and two upper body-dominant days.</p><p>Block 2 is a Strength and Power block, and is organized a little differently. Two of the days are \'Strength\' days, with higher RPE values, thus focusing on heavy weight. The other two days are \'Power\' or \'Speed\' days, staying short of failure and selecting weights that you can move quickly. Each Strength Card will be marked \'Strength\' or \'Power\' to help you remember.</p> <b>WHAT IS A STRENGTH STOP?</b><p>We now have a new use for RPE! Rather than simply marking how hard a particular set was, we can begin to use RPE to control total volume performed and corresponding fatigue levels for each training session. On certain main exercises you will see a desired RPE as usual, and a new column marked \'Strength Stop\'. Rather than perform a predetermined number of sets, you will perform sets at the given repetition number and weight until your RPE value reaches the Strength Stop value, at which point you will move on to the next exercise. For example, say I am performing my Squat pattern exercise for sets of 4 at a 9 RPE, with 10 RPE as my Strength Stop. I work up to 200 pounds for 4 repetitions at a 9 RPE. I will now perform sets of 4 at 200 pounds until I reach a 10 RPE:</p>

<!-- LEVEL 16 -->
<p>Here are some new things you need to know:</p><p>Levels 16 and on still have two blocks per level, a Volume Block and a Strength/Power block. The \'Power\' days in the Strength block will continue to utilize Strength Stops, however for our strength or volume focused training sessions we have a new way to further utilize RPE and control training stress: the Strength Drop. The Strength Drop works similarly to the Strength Stop, in that you will work up to a set at the desired RPE listed. The Strength Card will then \'drop\' the weight you used by a certain percentage, and you will perform sets at this new weight until the desired RPE is again achieved, after which you will move on to the next exercise. For example, say I perform my Squat pattern exercise, working up to a set of 4 at a 9 RPE, with 7% as my Strength Drop. I work up to 300 pounds for 4 repetitions at a 9 RPE. I will now perform sets of 4 at 280 pounds (300 x .07 = 21, 300-21 = 279 =280 lbs) until I reach a 9 RPE again:</p>
